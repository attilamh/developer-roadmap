> Roadmap to becoming a web developer in 2017

Below you find a set of charts demonstrating the paths that you can take and the technologies that you would want to adopt in order to become a frontend, backend or a devops. I made these charts for an old professor of mine who wanted something to share with his college students to give them a perspective.

If you think that these can be improved in anyway, please do suggest.

## ðŸš€ Introduction

## ðŸŽ¨ Front-end Roadmap

## ðŸ‘½ Back-end Roadmap

For the backend, your choice should be based on the complexity of the application. For any web-app that is expected to have high load, high volume, your choice should be Java. For quick prototyping Python would be my preferred choice, perhaps PHP. Ruby is also a fun language and would work. Again, depends on your needs.
